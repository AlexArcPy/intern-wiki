## How to get support

* Are you having difficulty using Intern? Try reading the [tutorial](https://github.com/theintern/intern-tutorial). You can also get [free support on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/intern?sort=frequent) using the tag \[[intern](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=intern)].
* Do you need a guaranteed response time, priority fixes, a non-disclosure, or the warm fuzzy feeling that youâ€™re providing financial support to the success of a useful open-source project? [Commercial support](http://www.sitepen.com/support/index.html) is available.
* Have you discovered a defect? Do you think a really cool new feature would make Intern a lot better? Check the [list of known issues](https://github.com/theintern/intern/issues) and submit a new one if you cannot find what you are encountering.
