Once you’ve run a test, you need to be able to get information out of Test Stack into a form that is actually useful to you. This is where Reporters come in. Reporters are modules that use a pub/sub architecture to receive specific messages about the tests being executed.

## Available Reporters
* [console](https://github.com/csnover/dojo2-teststack/blob/master/lib/reporters/console.js) - outputs test pass/fail messages to the console, grouped by suite
* [lcov](https://github.com/csnover/dojo2-teststack/blob/master/lib/reporters/lcov.js) - generates an <code>lcov.info</code> from collated coverage data
* [runner](https://github.com/csnover/dojo2-teststack/blob/master/lib/reporters/runner.js) - outputs current state of the runner, code coverage and test results for each environment tested, and a total test result
* [webdriver](https://github.com/csnover/dojo2-teststack/blob/master/lib/reporters/webdriver.js) - proxies test results from a client back to the test runner via the instrumentation proxy; also displays very basic running test output as HTML to provide improved state information when watching a test run via Sauce Labs live view

## Custom Reporters

As mentioned, Reporters are extremely simple modules. These modules subscribe to message channels that provide the information they care about, such as when a test passes or fails.

### Available Topics

<table>
<tr>
<th scope="col">Topic</th>
<th scope="col">Platform</th>
<th scope="col">Parameters</th>
<th scope="col">Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">/client/end</th>
<td>client, runner</td>
<td><code>sessionId</code> - a string representing the remote client’s session ID</td>
<td>This topic is published when a client has finished executing all of its unit tests. It is used primarily as an indicator to start running functional tests.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">/coverage</th>
<td>runner</td>
<td><code>sessionId</code> - a string representing the remote environment’s session ID<br>
<code>coverage</code> - an Object containing instrumentation coverage usable by Istanbul</td>
<td>This topic is published when code coverage data has been retrieved from an environment under test. This will occur once for each remote environment when all unit tests have completed, and again at the end of each functional suite.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">/error</th>
<td>runner</td>
<td><code>error</code> - an Error object or string generated by <code>Error#toString()</code></td>
<td>This topic is published whenever an error occurs anywhere within Test Stack. These errors may be test failures, or they may be more serious errors from outside the test code itself.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">/session/end</th>
<td>runner</td>
<td><code>remote</code> - A PromisedWebDriver instance</td>
<td>This topic is published after a test environment has finished running all of its tests and has been cleaned up.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">/session/start</th>
<td>runner</td>
<td><code>remote</code> - A PromisedWebDriver instance</td>
<td>This topic is published after a test environment has been successfully initialised but before it has been instructed to run any tests.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">/runner/start</th>
<td>runner</td>
<td>(none)</td>
<td>This topic is published after the runner has finished its configuration process and has started the Sauce Connect server, if one is being used. It is published immediately before the test suite starts running.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">/runner/end</th>
<td>runner</td>
<td>(none)</td>
<td>This topic is published after the runner has finished running all test suites and is ready to shut down.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">/suite/end</th>
<td>client, runner</td>
<td><code>suite</code> - A Suite instance</td>
<td>This topic is published when a suite has finished running. It is called regardless of whether or not an error has occurred. If an error occurred, it will exist at <code>suite.error</code>. If <code>suite.publishAfterSetup</code> is true, this topic will be published <em>before</em> suite teardown occurs; otherwise, it will be published after teardown has completed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">/suite/error</th>
<td>client, runner</td>
<td><code>suite</code> - A Suite instance</td>
<td>This topic is published when an error occurs within a test suite. The error that was thrown can be found at <code>suite.error</code>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">/suite/start</th>
<td>client, runner</td>
<td><code>suite</code> - A Suite instance</td>
<td>This topic is published when a suite is about to start executing. If <code>suite.publishAfterSetup</code> is true, this topic will be published <em>after</em> suite setup has completed; otherwise, it will be published before setup has started.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">/test/end</th>
<td>client, runner</td>
<td><code>test</code> - A Test instance</td>
<td>This topic is published after a test has finished executing. The error that caused the failure can be found at <code>test.error</code>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">/test/fail</th>
<td>client, runner</td>
<td><code>test</code> - A Test instance</td>
<td>This topic is published when a test fails. The error that caused the failure can be found at <code>test.error</code>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th scope="row">/test/pass</th>
<td>client, runner</td>
<td><code>test</code> - A Test instance</td>
<td>This topic is published when a test passes.</td>

<tr>
<th scope="row">/test/start</th>
<td>client, runner</td>
<td><code>test</code> - A Test instance</td>
<td>This topic is published immediately before a test starts.</td>
